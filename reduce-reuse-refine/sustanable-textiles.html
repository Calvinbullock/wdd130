                So in this article, I will be talking about how to get the most out of the clothing you buy. The
                first
                step here is to get durable and high quality, you don't have to buy it new. Thrifting is a very good
                way
                to find quality clothing for the cheap. Thrifting keeps clothes out of landfills and helps reduce
                the
                strain and pollution of making new clothes. Also looking for deals is another great way to get
                quality
                clothes. here are some images of textile items I have had for varying amounts of time. The first is
                my
                bag, I have had this bag for 10+ years and it's still in fairly good shape. The bottom is starting
                to
                wear out but I hope to find a way to reaper that and help this bag live on. The next is my jacket
                this
                jacket and the hoodie next to it are my two main outerwear and I have had both for several years. I
                have
                sowed the jacket up a few times myself, and the windbreaker is still in great condition even with a
                bit
                of wear. Learning how to repair items dramatically helps to decrease your consumption and waste.
                Here
                are some statistics front the U.S government on textiles. The recycling rate for all textiles was
                14.7
                percent in 2018, with 2.5 million tons recycled. Within this figure, EPA estimated that the
                recycling
                rate for textiles in clothing and footwear was 13 percent based on information from the American
                Textile
                Recycling Service. The rate for items such as sheets and pillowcases was 15.8 percent in 2018. The
                total
                amount of textiles in MSW combusted in 2018 was 3.2 million tons. This was 9.3 percent of MSW
                combusted
                with energy recovery. Landfills received 11.3 million tons of MSW textiles in 2018. This was 7.7
                percent
                of all MSW landfilled3. We can reduce what we buy only to what we need and reduce what we trough
                away if
                we learn a few simple skills of repair and learn to treasure our textiles and the stories they carry
                instead of giving into the consumer culture pushing us to the new and never enough mentality

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I want to help consumers and produces to see how there actions are helping and destroying the environment.
      We offten don't give a second thought to what we use and trough away but so much of what we use could be
      reduced and resued and even refined. We as a generation need to learn and push for multi use and long term
      use products. Things that can be repared and reused. We as consumers need to know and care about this to
      have any hope of changing it, that is where mysite will come in. </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is people who are looking for ways to reduce their impact on the planet while also finding
      better and more efficient ways to live. But it also those who aren't yet interested in these issues, I
      want to help inspire everyone to care about the industries they support and see that we as consumers
      have the power to influence what gets made and how. My audience is anyone who is part of the consumer
      market even companies themselves.</p> <!-- change this -->

    <h3>[Page 2] Sustanible Technolagy</h3>
    <p>
      I try to get computers that can last up to five years the weakest link is often the battery, and once a battery
      dies witch takes about 500 - 600 cycles (a charge from 0 to 100% or say a change from 50% to 100% then discharge
      to 50% then back to 100%). Once a battery dies it mostly renders a mobile device useless and resigns it to life in
      the trash or life in a box. But there are companies out there seeking ways to lengthen the time of use. We have
      been fed the idea that technology can’t be reparable and easy to use while also being sleek and portable. But in
      recent years companies like Dell, a major brand in computers have tried to keep much of there upgradability on
      their main laptops like the Dell XPS. And several companies have emerged to challenge this idea specifically. One
      that has done a fantastic job is the framework comapniey1. But technology isn't the only place this movement is
      taking place. They are trying to make their products better and even change the packaging to be sustainable sony
      has worked to make the majority of their packaging2. Companies are changing but we need to help them, we need to
      take the action to support companies and use the upgradeable features. Even apple who for years fought against
      reparability has been forced into selling replacement batteries and parts for their phones because of the right to
      repair act4. But all the efforts that individual groups and companies have done to push for sustainability will be
      for naught if we as consumers don’t act to support them. IFixit is a company that sells tools and guides to fix
      any imaginable device. They have ratings for repairability. There are companies that care now it's time for us as
      consumers to care.

    <h3>[Page 3] Sustanable textiles</h3>
    <p>
      So in this section, I will be talking about how to get the most out of the clothing you buy. The first step here
      is to get durable and high quality, you don't have to buy it new. Thrifting is a very good way to find quality
      clothing for the cheap. Thrifting keeps clothes out of landfills and helps reduce the strain and pollution of
      making new clothes. Also looking for deals is another great way to get quality clothes. here are some images of
      textile items I have had for varying amounts of time. The first is my bag, I have had this bag for 10+ years and
      it's still in fairly good shape. The bottom is starting to wear out but I hope to find a way to reaper that and
      help this bag live on. The next is my jacket this jacket and the hoodie next to it are my two main outerwear and I
      have had both for several years. I have sowed the jacket up a few times myself, and the windbreaker is still in
      great condition even with a bit of wear. Learning how to repair items dramatically helps to decrease your
      consumption and waste. Here are some statistics front the U.S government on textiles.

      The recycling rate for all textiles was 14.7 percent in 2018, with 2.5 million tons recycled. Within this figure,
      EPA estimated that the recycling rate for textiles in clothing and footwear was 13 percent based on information
      from the American Textile Recycling Service. The rate for items such as sheets and pillowcases was 15.8 percent in
      2018.

      The total amount of textiles in MSW combusted in 2018 was 3.2 million tons. This was 9.3 percent of MSW combusted
      with energy recovery.

      Landfills received 11.3 million tons of MSW textiles in 2018. This was 7.7 percent of all MSW landfilled3.

      We can reduce what we buy only to what we need and reduce what we trough away if we learn a few simple skills of
      repair and learn to treasure our textiles and the stories they carry instead of giving into the consumer culture
      pushing us to the new and never enough mentality

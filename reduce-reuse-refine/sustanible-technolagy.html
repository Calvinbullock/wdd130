            <h1>Sustanible Technolagy</h1>
            <p>
                I try to get computers that can last up to five years the weakest link is often the battery, and once a
                battery dies witch takes about 500 - 600 cycles (a charge from 0 to 100% or say a change from 50% to
                100% then discharge to 50% then back to 100%). Once a battery dies it mostly renders a mobile device
                useless and resigns it to life in the trash or life in a box. But there are companies out there seeking
                ways to lengthen the time of use. We have been fed the idea that technology can't be reparable and easy
                to use while also being sleek and portable. But in recent years companies like Dell, a major brand in
                computers have tried to keep much of there upgradability on their main laptops like the Dell XPS. And
                several companies have emerged to challenge this idea specifically. One that has done a fantastic job is
                the framework comapniey1. But technology isn't the only place this movement is taking place. They are
                trying to make their products better and even change the packaging to be sustainable sony has worked to
                make the majority of their packaging2. Companies are changing but we need to help them, we need to take
                the action to support companies and use the upgradeable features. Even apple who for years fought
                against reparability has been forced into selling replacement batteries and parts for their phones
                because of the right to repair act4. But all the efforts that individual groups and companies have done
                to push for sustainability will be for naught if we as consumers don't act to support them. IFixit is a
                company that sells tools and guides to fix any imaginable device. They have ratings for repairability.
                There are companies that care now it's time for us as consumers to care.
